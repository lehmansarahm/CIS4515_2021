# CIS 4515 - Lab 1

The following lab was completed using:
- Android Studio "Arctic Fox", v2021.3.1, Patch 2
- Pixel 2 emulator (API 28, 11GB of allotted disk size)

Here are the steps that I followed in order to complete this lab:
1. Start a new Android Studio project with a "basic" activity template to handle the login / register functionality
   - Renamed to LoginActivity, LoginFragment, RegisterFragment, nav_login_register as appropriate
2. Add a secondary activity using the "Google Maps" template
